# Emotion Classification Using NLP

## Project Statement

The goal of this project is to develop an emotion classification model using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The aim is to accurately classify emotions such as happiness, sorrow, anger, fear, and others from textual data. This model will be useful for various applications, such as analyzing customer feedback, detecting sentiment in social media, and enhancing chatbots by detecting user emotions in real time.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of text entries where each piece of text corresponds to an emotion label, such as happiness, sorrow, rage, scare, care, or amazement. The text data varies in length and content, representing different types of emotional expressions. A significant challenge identified in the dataset is **class imbalance**—some emotions, like happiness and sorrow, are much more frequent than others. This imbalance needs to be addressed to ensure the model performs well across all emotion categories.

## Data Processing and Prediction

### Data Preprocessing
**Data Preprocessing** is a critical step in preparing the raw text data for model training. The first task involves cleaning the text by converting all characters to lowercase, ensuring uniformity across the dataset. Then, **punctuation**, **special characters**, and **numbers** are removed, as these elements typically do not contribute to the emotion being conveyed. Another important step is removing **stop words**—common words like "the," "is," and "and"—which occur frequently but don’t carry significant meaning for emotion classification.

Following this, the cleaned text is **tokenized**, which means breaking down each text into individual words (or tokens). This allows the model to analyze the text at a granular level. Each token (word) is then converted into a numerical form, a process known as **feature extraction**. Several techniques are used to achieve this, including:

- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: This method transforms the text into a matrix where each word is assigned a score based on how frequently it appears in a document relative to its frequency in the entire dataset. This highlights the important words that are specific to each document and helps in emotion detection.
- **Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)**: These are more advanced techniques that capture the contextual meaning of words by converting them into vectors of real numbers. Word embeddings allow the model to understand the relationships between words, making it easier to detect emotions even when different words are used to convey similar feelings.

### Handling Class Imbalance
The issue of **class imbalance** in the dataset is addressed. In emotion classification, certain emotions, like happiness and sorrow, occur much more frequently than others. This imbalance can lead the model to become biased, favoring the more common emotions and failing to properly learn the less frequent ones. To solve this, two techniques are employed:

- **Oversampling**: This involves increasing the number of instances for the less frequent emotions by replicating them or generating synthetic examples. This ensures that rare emotions like "amazement" are better represented in the training process.
- **Undersampling**: Here, the number of instances for more frequent emotions is reduced, creating a more balanced dataset. By doing this, the model is prevented from becoming biased towards the dominant emotions.

### Model Training
After the preprocessing is complete, the cleaned and balanced data is used to train several machine learning models. Some of the key models used include:

- **Logistic Regression**: A simple yet effective algorithm that is commonly used for binary and multiclass classification tasks. It is used here to classify emotions based on the numerical representation of the text.
- **Random Forest**: This is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting. It helps in capturing complex patterns between the words and the corresponding emotions.
- **Decision Tree**: This model splits the data into branches based on certain features, making decisions at each node to classify the emotion. While it's simple, it can capture clear decision boundaries between different emotional categories.

To ensure the best performance, the models are **fine-tuned** using **GridSearchCV**, a method that tests different combinations of model parameters to find the most optimal settings. This helps in improving the accuracy of emotion classification.

### Testing on Unknown Data
Once the models are trained, they are tested on **unknown data**—text entries that the model has never seen before. This step is crucial for evaluating how well the model generalizes to new data and predicting emotions in real-world scenarios. By testing on this unknown data, the model's robustness is assessed, ensuring that it can accurately classify emotions in a variety of real-world applications.

### Model Evaluation
In addition to accuracy, performance metrics like **ROC AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under the Curve)** are used to evaluate the models. This helps in comparing the effectiveness of different models in predicting the correct emotions. The end result is a reliable emotion classification model that can be applied to real-world tasks like customer feedback analysis, sentiment analysis in social media, and chatbot emotion detection, ensuring its versatility across different use cases.
